        <p class="card-text">Historically, those with more-serious mental health conditions were relegated to a lifetime in asylums or other psychiatric facilities. Even when they lived in the community, they were siloed in communal living situations and daily treatment programs. They were told they could never live independently, work, have a family. The mental health field had no hopes of recovery for this population. Perpetual illness was the bleak expectation, and this lack of hope transferred to those we served.
Today, new philosophies focus on strengths and abilities, rather than on weaknesses and disabilities. And new medications enable people to carry out their dreams, with minimal interference from symptoms.  We recognize the importance of work and social factors in recovery. And we embrace the contributions of peers—people whose similar mental health conditions help them relate to and engage others through shared experience. People who are diagnosed with mental health conditions can live fulfilling and productive lives and become valued and contributing members of society.</p>
