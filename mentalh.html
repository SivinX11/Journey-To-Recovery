        <h5 class="card-title">Know The Reality</h5>
        <p class="card-text">We always talk about being cheerful and lively in life. When was the last time you had looked in the mirror and asked yourself whether you are really happy and satisfied with what you are doing in life? If you haven’t tried it, you might want to try it now. We expect the youth to be the future backbone of this country. However, judging by statistics of mental health, the future seems extremely blurred.
India has one of the world’s highest suicide rates for youth aged 15 to 29, according to a 2012 Lancet report. Every hour, one student commits suicide in India, according to 2015 data (the latest available) from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Youngsters find it difficult to cope with failure in examinations and careers. Neither families nor other social institutions offer adequate support or solace. Its many commercial coaching centres, that guarantee success in professional entrance exams, pressure students into striving for unrealistic goals. Unable to cope with failure and anxious about letting their family down, a growing number of students opt to end their lives.</p>
       <p>   Financial issues dominate the reasons for suicide; the NCRB data revealed about 70% of suicide victims in 2015 had an income of less than Rs 100,000 per annum. Even though this figure isn’t disaggregated for students, it corroborated the study’s findings on the links between suicide and financial condition.
My question is what career choices are we thrusting on our youth which forces them to give up their lives. The popular perception is that failing exams or inability to cope with academics is the primary reason for student suicides. We need a career to support ourselves and our loved ones in life but then why do we end up sacrificing it to achieve our goals.
Various issues like anxiety, extreme depression, extreme mood swings, impulsiveness, eating disorders are seen commonly in college students.</p>

<p>Student suicides are now drawing the attention of policymakers and celebrity campaigners. In his Mann Ki Baat radio speech on 27 March 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged Indians to talk about depression and seek help if needed.
Universities in India still lack counselling centres, where trained counsellors and psychologists can assist students at the onset of emotional and mental problems so they do not spiral into full-fledged clinical depression and lead to suicide.
India faces a staggering 87% shortage of mental-health professionals. There are 3,800 psychiatrists, 898 clinical psychologists, 850 psychiatric social workers and 1,500 psychiatric nurses nationwide, according to a reply by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in the Lok Sabha in December 2015. This means there were three psychiatrists per million people, according to data from WHO, 95% fewer than the Commonwealth norm of 5.6 psychiatrists per 100,000 people. By this estimate, India is short of 66,200 psychiatrists.
People in India hesitate to accept that they are suffering from depression and do not understand that mental illness is a medical condition which needs to be treated. Some problems might not appear on the surface but that does not imply they do not affect our lives. </p>
<p>  The remedy lies in raising awareness about mental health in schools and colleges. Mental health and wellness should be added to the school curriculum. Children need to be taught about these disorders in their formative years. There should be sexuality and life skills education in schools and colleges. Parents play a major role as well in this process. There should be parenting classes to help parents understand their child’s problem and help them overcome them instead of giving up. Sometimes just listening helps too. It’s not necessary to always judge and pinpoint mistakes. There is a correct time for everything.</p>
<p> Winning-losing is not in your hands. The spirit and the positivity one should have while dealing is in your hands. You are not alone.</p></p>
